When looking at my cause many people might believe that I am a hedonist or that I don't wish to work but the reason my cause is to have fun is because I wish to work hard for a job I love so that in my future I can have fun everyday I go to work.  I can uderstand confusion that my cause description might have caused and the fault partially lies on me for not creating a more detailed or explanatory cause.
