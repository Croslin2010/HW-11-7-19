When looking at my cause many people might believe that I am a hedonist or that I don't wish to work but the reason my cause is to have fun is because I wish to work hard for a job I love so that in my future I can have fun everyday I go to work.  I can uderstand confusion that my cause description might have caused and the fault partially lies on me for not creating a more detailed or explanatory cause.  It should be noted that since I am the one that wrote and created the the cause and it was supposed to represent what I believed so it would make since if I had the final say on what it represents.
